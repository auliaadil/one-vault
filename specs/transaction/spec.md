# Feature Specification: Transaction

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[001-transaction-feature]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Users want to record and track both income and expenses, capture receipts, extract details via OCR, categorize transactions, and view a transaction history.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Record a Transaction (Priority: P1)
Users can manually add a new transaction (income or expense) by entering the amount, date, merchant, and selecting a category.

**Why this priority**: Core value of the app; enables basic finance tracking.

**Independent Test**: Add a transaction and verify it appears in the transaction history with correct details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user is on the add transaction screen, **When** they enter valid details and save, **Then** the transaction is stored locally and shown in the history.
2. **Given** the user enters an invalid amount, **When** they try to save, **Then** an error is shown and the transaction is not saved.

### User Story 2 - Capture Receipt and Extract Details (Priority: P2)
Users can use the camera to capture a receipt. The app uses OCR to extract the date, total amount, and merchant, and auto-fills these fields in the add transaction form.

**Why this priority**: Greatly improves speed and accuracy of data entry.

**Independent Test**: Capture a sample receipt and verify extracted details are correct and editable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user captures a clear receipt, **When** OCR runs, **Then** the date, total, and merchant fields are auto-filled.
2. **Given** the OCR result is incorrect, **When** the user edits the fields, **Then** the changes are saved.

---

### User Story 3 - Categorize Transactions (Priority: P3)
Users can assign categories (e.g., Food, Transport, Utilities) to each transaction and filter or search by category in the transaction history.

**Why this priority**: Enables organization and analysis of spending/income.

**Independent Test**: Assign categories to transactions and filter the history view by category.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** transactions with different categories exist, **When** the user filters by a category, **Then** only matching transactions are shown.
2. **Given** a transaction is edited to change its category, **When** saved, **Then** the new category is reflected in the history.

---

### User Story 4 - View Transaction History (Priority: P4)
Users can view a chronological list of all transactions, with details and receipt images if available.

**Why this priority**: Provides a clear record and overview of financial activity.

**Independent Test**: Add several transactions and verify they appear in the correct order with all details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** multiple transactions exist, **When** the user opens the history, **Then** all transactions are listed with correct details and images.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the device camera is unavailable or permission is denied?
- How does the system handle blurry or unreadable receipts?
- What if OCR extracts incorrect or incomplete data?
- How are duplicate transactions prevented?
- How does the app behave with a very large transaction history?
