# Feature Specification: Credential Manager

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[006-credential-manager]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Users want to securely store credentials (title, username, password, notes) in encrypted local storage, with vault access protected by a master PIN or password.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add and Store Credentials (Priority: P1)
Users can add new credentials by entering a title, username, password, and optional notes. All data is stored locally and encrypted.

**Why this priority**: Core value for a credential manager; ensures secure storage of sensitive information.

**Independent Test**: Add a credential and verify it is stored, encrypted, and retrievable after app restart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user is on the add credential screen, **When** they enter valid details and save, **Then** the credential is encrypted and stored locally.
2. **Given** the app is restarted, **When** the user unlocks the vault, **Then** the credential is accessible.

### User Story 2 - Vault Unlock with Master PIN/Password (Priority: P2)
The app requires the user to enter a master PIN or password to unlock the credential vault. Optionally, biometric unlock can be enabled.

**Why this priority**: Ensures only authorized users can access stored credentials.

**Independent Test**: Set a master PIN/password, lock the vault, and verify credentials are inaccessible until the correct PIN/password is entered.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the vault is locked, **When** the user enters the correct PIN/password, **Then** the vault unlocks and credentials are accessible.
2. **Given** the user enters an incorrect PIN/password, **When** attempted, **Then** access is denied and an error is shown.

---

### User Story 3 - Edit and Delete Credentials (Priority: P3)
Users can edit or delete existing credentials. All changes are encrypted and saved locally.

**Why this priority**: Maintains up-to-date and relevant credential data.

**Independent Test**: Edit a credential and verify changes persist; delete a credential and verify it is removed from storage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a credential exists, **When** the user edits and saves, **Then** the updated credential is encrypted and stored.
2. **Given** a credential exists, **When** the user deletes it, **Then** it is removed from local storage.

---

### User Story 4 - Secure Notes (Priority: P4)
Users can add optional notes to each credential, which are encrypted and stored with the credential.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to store additional sensitive information securely.

**Independent Test**: Add a note to a credential and verify it is encrypted and retrievable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a credential, **When** the user adds a note, **Then** the note is encrypted and stored with the credential.

---

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the user forgets the master PIN/password?
- How does the app handle failed unlock attempts (e.g., lockout, delay)?
- What if the device is lost or reset?
- How are credentials migrated if the user changes the master PIN/password?
- How does the app behave offline or with a large number of credentials?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
