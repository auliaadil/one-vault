# Feature Specification: App-Wide Lock with Biometric Authentication

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[011-app-lock]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Define an app-wide lock system that uses the user’s biometric authentication to unlock the vault. The lock applies across all modules.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - App-Wide Lock Activation (Priority: P1)
The app automatically locks all modules (transactions, credentials, files, settings) when triggered (e.g., on launch, after timeout, or when minimized).

**Why this priority**: Ensures all sensitive data is protected at all times.

**Independent Test**: Trigger the lock and verify that all modules are inaccessible until unlocked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the app is locked, **When** the user tries to access any module, **Then** access is denied and the unlock screen is shown.

---

### User Story 2 - Biometric Unlock (Priority: P2)
Users can unlock the app using biometric authentication (fingerprint, face, etc.) if enabled on the device.

**Why this priority**: Provides secure and convenient access to the vault.

**Independent Test**: Enable biometric unlock, lock the app, and verify that biometric authentication unlocks all modules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** biometric unlock is enabled, **When** the user authenticates, **Then** the app unlocks and all modules become accessible.
2. **Given** biometric unlock fails or is canceled, **When** attempted, **Then** access remains denied and the user is prompted again or offered fallback.

---

### User Story 3 - Fallback to PIN/Password (Priority: P3)
If biometric authentication is unavailable or fails, users can unlock the app with their master PIN or password.

**Why this priority**: Ensures access is always possible, even if biometrics are not available.

**Independent Test**: Disable biometrics or simulate failure, then unlock with PIN/password and verify access.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** biometric unlock is unavailable, **When** the user enters the correct PIN/password, **Then** the app unlocks.
2. **Given** the user enters an incorrect PIN/password, **When** attempted, **Then** access is denied and the user is prompted again.

---

### User Story 4 - Lock Applies Across All Modules (Priority: P4)
The lock state is enforced globally, so unlocking once grants access to all modules until the next lock event.

**Why this priority**: Simplifies user experience and ensures consistent security.

**Independent Test**: Unlock the app and verify all modules are accessible; trigger a lock and verify all modules are locked again.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the app is unlocked, **When** the user navigates between modules, **Then** no additional unlock is required.
2. **Given** the app is locked, **When** the user tries to access any module, **Then** the unlock screen is shown.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the device’s biometric hardware is unavailable or malfunctioning?
- How does the app handle rapid lock/unlock cycles?
- What if the user disables biometrics after enabling it in the app?
- How are lock state and authentication handled during app updates or device reboots?
- How does the app behave with multiple users or profiles on the same device?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an app-wide lock that applies to all modules and sensitive data.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support biometric authentication (fingerprint, face, etc.) for unlocking if available on the device.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a fallback to master PIN/password if biometrics are unavailable or fail.
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce the lock state globally, so unlocking once grants access to all modules until the next lock event.
- **FR-005**: System MUST store all lock state and authentication data locally, encrypted at rest.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support offline use for all lock and unlock features.
- **FR-007**: System MUST follow clean architecture, MVVM, and Compose best practices.
- **FR-008**: All features MUST include unit and integration tests.
- **FR-009**: All critical lock/unlock operations MUST complete within 200ms.
- **FR-010**: UI MUST follow Material Design 3 and be accessible.

### Key Entities
- **AppLockState**: Represents the global lock/unlock state of the app.
- **BiometricAuth**: Represents biometric authentication configuration and status.
- **PINPasswordAuth**: Represents master PIN/password fallback authentication.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: Users can lock and unlock the app across all modules using biometrics or PIN/password without network access.
- **SC-002**: All lock state and authentication data remain local and encrypted.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users can unlock the app in under 5 seconds using biometrics or PIN/password.
- **SC-004**: Lock/unlock operations complete in under 200ms.
