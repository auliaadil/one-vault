# Feature Specification: App-Wide Design Guidelines

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[014-design-guidelines]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Define app-wide design guidelines ensuring consistent colors, typography, icons, and interactions across all modules. Support dark and light modes. For now, follow the current Color.kt and Theme.kt.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Consistent Color Palette (Priority: P1)
All modules use a unified color palette as defined in Color.kt, ensuring brand consistency and accessibility in both light and dark modes.

**Why this priority**: Maintains a cohesive visual identity and improves usability.

**Independent Test**: Review all screens in both light and dark modes and verify color usage matches the palette.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the app is in light or dark mode, **When** the user navigates any module, **Then** all UI elements use the correct colors from Color.kt.

---

### User Story 2 - Unified Typography (Priority: P2)
Typography is consistent across all modules, following a defined set of text styles (e.g., headings, body, captions) for readability and hierarchy.

**Why this priority**: Ensures information is easy to scan and understand.

**Independent Test**: Inspect text elements in all modules and verify they use the correct typography styles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** any screen, **When** text is displayed, **Then** it uses the correct style for its purpose (heading, body, etc.).

---

### User Story 3 - Standardized Icons and Interactions (Priority: P3)
All modules use a consistent icon set and interaction patterns (e.g., button shapes, navigation, feedback) for a seamless user experience.

**Why this priority**: Reduces user confusion and learning curve.

**Independent Test**: Compare icons and interactions across modules and verify consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** any feature, **When** the user interacts with buttons, menus, or icons, **Then** the experience is consistent with other modules.

---

### User Story 4 - Dark and Light Mode Support (Priority: P4)
The app supports both dark and light modes, automatically adapting all UI elements using the color schemes defined in Theme.kt.

**Why this priority**: Improves accessibility and user comfort in different environments.

**Independent Test**: Switch between dark and light modes and verify all UI elements adapt correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user changes the system theme, **When** the app is opened, **Then** all UI elements update to the appropriate color scheme.

---

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a new module is added without following the guidelines?
- How does the app handle custom user themes or accessibility overrides?
- What if a device does not support dark mode?
- How are deprecated or updated colors/styles managed?
- How does the app behave with very large or complex screens?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
