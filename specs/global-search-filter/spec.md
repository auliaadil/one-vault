# Feature Specification: Global Search & Filter

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[013-global-search-filter]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Define a global search function that lets users search across transactions and credentials by keyword and category. Also define a global filter based on date for transactions.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Global Keyword Search (Priority: P1)
Users can enter a keyword in a global search bar to find matching transactions and credentials.

**Why this priority**: Enables fast access to relevant data across the vault.

**Independent Test**: Enter a keyword and verify that all matching transactions and credentials are displayed in the results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** transactions and credentials exist, **When** the user searches for a keyword, **Then** all relevant results are shown, grouped by type.

---

### User Story 2 - Search by Category (Priority: P2)
Users can filter search results by transaction category or credential type.

**Why this priority**: Improves precision and relevance of search results.

**Independent Test**: Select a category/type and verify that only matching results are shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** categories and types exist, **When** the user selects a filter, **Then** only results matching the filter are displayed.

---

### User Story 3 - Global Date Filter for Transactions (Priority: P3)
Users can apply a global date filter to limit transaction search results to a specific date range.

**Why this priority**: Supports time-based analysis and review of financial activity.

**Independent Test**: Set a date range and verify that only transactions within that range are shown in the results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** transactions with various dates exist, **When** the user sets a date filter, **Then** only transactions within the range are displayed.

---

### User Story 4 - Combined Search and Filter (Priority: P4)
Users can combine keyword, category/type, and date filters for precise results.

**Why this priority**: Maximizes flexibility and user control over search.

**Independent Test**: Enter a keyword, select a category, and set a date range; verify that only results matching all criteria are shown.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** multiple filters are set, **When** the user searches, **Then** only results matching all filters are displayed.

---

### Edge Cases
- What happens if no results are found for the search/filter?
- How does the app handle very large result sets?
- What if a user enters an invalid date range?
- How are search and filter states reset or cleared?
- How does the app behave offline?
