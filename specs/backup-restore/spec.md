# Feature Specification: Backup and Restore

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[010-backup-restore]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Define a backup and restore feature that exports all vault data as a single encrypted file (.onevault), which can be re-imported to restore user data locally.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Export All Data as Encrypted Backup (Priority: P1)
Users can export all vault data (transactions, credentials, files, categories, settings) as a single encrypted file with the .onevault extension.

**Why this priority**: Protects against data loss and enables device migration.

**Independent Test**: Export a backup, verify the .onevault file is created and cannot be opened without the correct credentials.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user initiates a backup, **When** the process completes, **Then** a .onevault file is created and stored locally or in a user-selected location.
2. **Given** the .onevault file is accessed outside the app, **When** opened, **Then** data remains inaccessible without decryption.

---

### User Story 2 - Restore Data from Encrypted Backup (Priority: P2)
Users can import a .onevault file to restore all vault data locally, replacing or merging with existing data as needed.

**Why this priority**: Enables recovery from data loss or device change.

**Independent Test**: Import a backup on a fresh install and verify all data is restored correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a valid .onevault file, **When** the user imports it, **Then** all vault data is restored and accessible after authentication.
2. **Given** an invalid or corrupted file, **When** import is attempted, **Then** the app notifies the user and does not overwrite existing data.

---

### User Story 3 - Secure Backup and Restore Process (Priority: P3)
The backup and restore process uses strong encryption and requires user authentication (PIN/password/biometric) to export or import data.

**Why this priority**: Ensures only authorized users can access or restore sensitive data.

**Independent Test**: Attempt backup/restore with and without correct authentication and verify access control.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user is not authenticated, **When** backup or restore is attempted, **Then** the operation is denied.
2. **Given** the user is authenticated, **When** backup or restore is performed, **Then** the operation completes securely.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the backup file is corrupted or tampered with?
- How does the app handle version mismatches between backup and current schema?
- What if the device runs out of storage during backup or restore?
- How are partial restores or failed imports handled?
- What if the user tries to import a backup while the vault is unlocked or in use?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to export all vault data as a single encrypted .onevault file.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to import a .onevault file to restore all vault data locally.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use strong encryption for all backup files and require user authentication for backup/restore operations.
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate backup file integrity and version before restoring.
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent data loss or corruption during backup and restore, with clear user notifications on errors.
- **FR-006**: System MUST store all backup files locally or in user-selected locations, never transmitting to external servers.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support offline use for all backup and restore features.
- **FR-008**: System MUST follow clean architecture, MVVM, and Compose best practices.
- **FR-009**: All features MUST include unit and integration tests.
- **FR-010**: All critical backup and restore operations MUST complete within 200ms for typical datasets.
- **FR-011**: UI MUST follow Material Design 3 and be accessible.

### Key Entities
- **VaultBackup**: Represents the encrypted backup file containing all vault data.
- **Transaction, Credential, VaultFile, TransactionCategory, Account, PasswordTemplate**: All entities included in the backup.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: Users can export and import .onevault files without network access.
- **SC-002**: All backup files remain encrypted and inaccessible without authentication.
- **SC-003**: 100% of valid backups restore all data without loss or corruption.
- **SC-004**: Backup and restore operations complete in under 200ms with 1000+ records.
