# Feature Specification: OCR Transaction Extraction

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[003-ocr-transaction-extraction]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Users want to extract transaction details from a photo of a receipt or bill using on-device OCR, with intelligent parsing and user review before saving.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Extract Text from Receipt (Priority: P1)
Users can take a photo of a receipt or bill, and the app uses on-device OCR to extract all visible text.

**Why this priority**: Enables fast, accurate data entry for transactions.

**Independent Test**: Take a photo of a clear receipt and verify that the text is extracted and displayed to the user.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user captures a receipt, **When** OCR runs, **Then** all visible text is extracted and shown in a preview.

---

### User Story 2 - Parse Key Details (Priority: P2)
The app parses the extracted text to intelligently detect the total amount, date, and merchant name using rule-based logic (e.g., regex, keyword matching).

**Why this priority**: Reduces manual entry and errors, improving user experience.

**Independent Test**: Extract text from a variety of receipts and verify that the app suggests the correct total, date, and merchant fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** extracted text from a receipt, **When** parsing runs, **Then** the most likely total, date, and merchant are auto-filled in the transaction form.
2. **Given** a receipt with ambiguous or missing data, **When** parsing runs, **Then** the user is prompted to review and correct fields.

---

### User Story 3 - User Review and Correction (Priority: P3)
Users can review and edit the extracted and parsed data before saving the transaction.

**Why this priority**: Ensures data accuracy and user control.

**Independent Test**: Edit the auto-filled fields and save the transaction, verifying that the correct data is stored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user reviews the extracted data, **When** they make corrections, **Then** the final saved transaction reflects the userâ€™s edits.

---

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the photo is blurry or poorly lit?
- How does the system handle receipts with multiple totals or currencies?
- What if the merchant name is not clearly present?
- How are parsing errors or failures communicated to the user?
- How does the app behave offline or with large/complex receipts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST use on-device OCR to extract all text from a receipt or bill photo.
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse extracted text to detect total amount, date, and merchant name using rule-based logic.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to review and edit extracted and parsed data before saving.
- **FR-004**: System MUST store all transaction data locally, encrypted at rest.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support offline use for all OCR and parsing features.
- **FR-006**: System MUST follow clean architecture, MVVM, and Compose best practices.
- **FR-007**: All features MUST include unit and integration tests.
- **FR-008**: All critical user interactions MUST complete within 200ms.
- **FR-009**: UI MUST follow Material Design 3 and be accessible.

### Key Entities
- **OCRResult**: Represents the raw and parsed text extracted from a receipt image.
- **Transaction**: Represents a single income or expense, with fields for amount, date, merchant, and image.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: Users can extract and parse transaction details from at least 80% of clear receipts without manual correction.
- **SC-002**: All OCR and parsing operations work offline and complete in under 2 seconds.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users can review and save a transaction in under 30 seconds after capturing a receipt.
- **SC-004**: All extracted and saved data remains local and encrypted.
