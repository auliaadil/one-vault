# Feature Specification: Credential Generator

## Overall Purpose
OneVault is a personal vault application designed to securely manage financial transactions, credentials, and important files. All user data is stored locally on the device, never transmitted to external servers, ensuring maximum privacy and offline usability. The app uses strong encryption for all sensitive data and supports biometric authentication. OneVault delivers a consistent, modern user experience following Material Design 3, making security and usability accessible to all users.

**Feature Branch**: `[007-credential-generator]`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Users want to generate strong passwords with customizable rules (length, symbols, numbers, mixed case), and copy or save the generated credential directly.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate a Strong Password (Priority: P1)
Users can generate a password by specifying rules such as length, inclusion of symbols, numbers, and mixed case.

**Why this priority**: Enables users to create secure, unique passwords for their accounts.

**Independent Test**: Set rules and generate a password; verify the password meets the specified criteria.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the user sets password rules, **When** they generate a password, **Then** the password matches the selected criteria (length, symbols, numbers, case).

---

### User Story 2 - Copy or Save Generated Credential (Priority: P2)
Users can copy the generated password to the clipboard or save it directly as a new credential in the vault.

**Why this priority**: Streamlines the process of using strong passwords and storing them securely.

**Independent Test**: Generate a password, copy it, and verify it is on the clipboard; save it and verify it appears in the credential list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a password is generated, **When** the user copies it, **Then** it is available on the clipboard.
2. **Given** a password is generated, **When** the user saves it, **Then** it is stored as a new credential in the vault.

---

### User Story 3 - Customizable Password Templates (Priority: P3)
Users can save and reuse custom password generation templates (e.g., for different services or requirements).

**Why this priority**: Increases efficiency and consistency for users with recurring password needs.

**Independent Test**: Create a template, use it to generate a password, and verify the template is reusable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a template is created, **When** the user selects it, **Then** the password generator uses the saved rules.

---

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the user sets conflicting or invalid rules (e.g., length too short for all required character types)?
- How does the app handle clipboard security and expiration?
- What if the user tries to save a password identical to an existing credential?
- How are templates managed if the user edits or deletes them?
- How does the app behave offline or with a large number of templates?
